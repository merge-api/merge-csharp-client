/// # The Team Object
/// ### Description
/// The `Team` object is used to represent a subdivision of the company, usually a department. Each employee will be grouped into one specific Team.
///
/// ### Usage Example
/// If you're building a way to filter by `Team`, you'd hit the `GET Teams` endpoint to fetch the `Teams`, and then use the `ID` of the team your user selects to filter the `GET Employees` endpoint.
